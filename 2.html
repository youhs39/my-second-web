  <h2> fix you </h2>
  <p>When you try your best but you don't succeed<br>
  When you get what you want but not what you need<br>
  When you feel so tired but you can't sleep<br>
  Stuck in reverse<br>
  And the tears come streaming down your face<br>
  When you lose something you can't replace<br>
  When you love someone but it goes to waste<br>
  Could it be worse?<br>
  Lights will guide you home<br>
  And ignite your bones<br>
  And I will try to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4V3Mo61fJM"
  target=_blank title="hear this song">fix you</a><br>
  And high up above or down below<br>
  When you're too in love to let it go<br>
  But if you never try you'll never know<br>
  Just what you're worth<br>
  Lights will guide you home<br>
  And ignite your bones<br>
  And I will try to fix you<br>
  Tears stream down your face<br>
  when you lose something you cannot replace<br>
  Tears stream down your face<br>
  And I<br>
  Tears stream down your face<br>
  I promise you I will learn from my mistakes<br>
  Tears stream down your face<br>
  And I<br>
  Lights will guide you home<br>
  And ignite your bones<br>
  And I will try to fix you<br>
