  <p>Oh they say people come<br>
They say people go<br>
This particular diamond was extra special<br>
And though you might be gone<br>
And the world may not know<br>
Still I see you celestial<br>
<br>
Like a lion you ran<br>
A goddess you roared<br>
Like an eagle you circled<br>
in perfect purple<br>
So how come things move on<br>
How come cars don't slow<br>
When it feels like the end of my world?<br>
When I should but I can't let you go?<br>
<br>
But when I'm cold, cold<br>
When I'm cold, cold<br>
There's a light that you give me<br>
When I'm in shadow<br>
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow<br>
<br>
Like brothers in blood<br>
Sisters who ride<br>
Yeah, We swore on that night<br>
We'd be friends 'til we died<br>
But the changing of winds<br>
And the way waters flow<br>
Life as short as the falling of snow<br>
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know<br>
<br>
But when I'm cold, cold<br>
In water rolled, salt<br>
I know you're always with me<br>
And the way you will show<br>
And you're with me wherever I go<br>
Cause you give me this feeling, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn_1hFdE-5g"
